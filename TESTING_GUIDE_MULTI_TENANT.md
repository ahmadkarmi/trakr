# üß™ Multi-Tenant Security Testing Guide

**Purpose:** Verify that multi-tenant security is working correctly and data is properly isolated between organizations.

---

## üéØ **Testing Objectives**

1. ‚úÖ Verify users only see their organization's data
2. ‚úÖ Verify Super Admins can switch between organizations
3. ‚úÖ Verify error states work correctly
4. ‚úÖ Verify empty states display properly
5. ‚úÖ Verify performance is acceptable

---

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites:**
```bash
# 1. Ensure dev server is running
npm run dev

# 2. Ensure database migration is applied
# Check Supabase dashboard > SQL Editor
# Migration: 20250107_multi_tenant_security_v2.sql

# 3. Have test users for different organizations
# - admin@trakr.com (Org 1)
# - branchmanager@trakr.com (Org 1)
# - auditor@trakr.com (Org 1)
# - (Create users in Org 2 for cross-org testing)
```

- Recent audits are only from this auditor

**Test Data Verification:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT 
  a.id, 
  a.org_id, 
  b.name as branch_name,
  u.name as auditor_name
FROM audits a
JOIN branches b ON a.branch_id = b.id
JOIN users u ON a.assigned_to = u.id
WHERE a.assigned_to = '[auditor-user-id]';

-- All org_ids should match the auditor's org_id

  roles,
  cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

**Expected:** Multiple policies on each table

---

### **Check Indexes Are Created:**
```sql
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  indexname,
  indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND indexname LIKE '%org_id%'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

**Expected:** Indexes on org_id columns

---

### **Check Data Isolation:**
```sql
-- Count records per organization
SELECT 
  'audits' as table_name,
  org_id,
  COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM audits
GROUP BY org_id

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'branches' as table_name,
  org_id,
  COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM branches
GROUP BY org_id

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'users' as table_name,
  org_id,
  COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM users
GROUP BY org_id

ORDER BY table_name, org_id;
```

**Expected:** Data distributed across organizations

---

## üö® **Security Red Flags**

### **Watch For:**

‚ùå **CRITICAL: Data Leakage**
- Seeing data from other organizations
- Cross-org entities in dropdowns
- Wrong org_id in network requests

‚ùå **CRITICAL: Unauthorized Access**
- Accessing other org's data by URL manipulation
- API returning unfiltered data
- Missing org_id in queries

‚ùå **HIGH: Performance Issues**
- Queries taking > 1 second
- Full table scans (check with EXPLAIN)
- Missing indexes

‚ùå **MEDIUM: UX Issues**
- Blank screens instead of empty states
- Crashes instead of error states
- No feedback on actions
