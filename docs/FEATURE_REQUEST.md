## Historical Context (Previous Flutter Implementation)

The following information is from the previous Flutter implementation for reference:
👥 User Roles
- **Super Admin**: Full control over users, surveys, analytics access, and audit logs.
- **Admin**: Manage surveys, questions, branches, users (except Super Admins), analytics, and approvals.
- **Auditor**: Sees only assigned audits. Can submit completed audits with photos and comments.
- **Branch Manager**: Can only view and approve/reject audits assigned to their branch.

📝 Surveys & Questions
- Admins can create and manage **multiple survey templates**.
- Each question includes: text, weight (optional), and visibility in scoring.
- Questions have Yes / No / N/A options only.
- When N/A is selected for a weighted question, the system requires the auditor to provide a justification.
- Admins can override N/A responses with a score, and this override is logged.
- Each survey is versioned: Any edit to questions (edit, add, delete, change weight) creates a new version.
- Completed surveys retain the original version context for traceability.

🔄 Audit Workflow
- Auditors see only the branches assigned to them this quarter.
- Audits include sections with image uploads, question responses, and comments.
- Once submitted, audits go to the respective Branch Manager for approval.
- Branch Managers review, comment, approve, or reject. Approved audits are archived and visible to Admins.
- Branch Managers can download PDF reports post-approval.
- Admins can edit questions post-completion. All changes are logged.

📜 Change Tracking & Logs
- Every action (survey edit, override, submission, approval, etc.) is logged.
- Logs include: User, timestamp, action, old/new values, and optional comments.
- Admin and Super Admin can export logs as PDF/CSV.
- Auditors see logs relevant to their submissions. Branch Managers see audit history for their branch.

📊 Scoring & Analytics
- Each audit generates a score based on weighted responses (excluding N/A).
- Sectional scores can be configured but default to equal distribution.
- Admin dashboard includes filters (date, location, auditor, status) and visual insights.
- Auditor dashboards show assigned audits, progress bars, and self-performance metrics.
- Branch Managers only see pending audits and performance summaries once approved.

🧾 PDF Reports
- Auditors and Admins can export completed audits to PDF.
- Report includes: Branch, date, auditor, question responses, images, scoring, and approval status.
- Footnote includes: Survey version, last edit timestamp, and original author.

🎨 Design Guidelines
- The interface should reflect a modern, minimalistic corporate style.
- Use **emojis as primary visual elements** instead of traditional icons for questions, alerts, and section indicators.
- Layout and UX flow should resemble premium audit dashboards with soft color palettes, crisp typography, and mobile responsiveness.
- Prioritize clarity and usability for users reviewing data across branches.

📌 Additional Notes
- Audit frequency defaults to quarterly but can be modified by Admin.
- Historical data must remain intact and reference the original survey version.
- Future changes to templates must not affect prior audit data unless explicitly approved.
- Audit reports and dashboards must include filters by version, branch, and status.

 
💼 SaaS Platform Architecture
The Branch Auditing Platform will function as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product. Organizations can sign up, pay a subscription fee, and receive access to their private instance managed through a Super Admin dashboard. Each organization will manage its own branches, users, surveys, and audits independently. 
🧾 Subscription & Onboarding Flow
- A pricing page will outline the tiers (based on number of branches, auditors, or audits per month).
- Upon payment, an organization account is provisioned automatically.
- The new Super Admin receives email confirmation and logs in to a clean instance.
- They can invite Admins, Auditors, and Branch Managers from their dashboard.
- Stripe or Paddle will be used for payment integration.

🏢 Tenant Isolation & Security
- Each organization will be treated as a separate tenant with isolated data.
- Multi-tenancy will be enforced at the database and application logic levels.
- Access controls are scoped to each organization.
- Users from one organization cannot access or view another’s data.

🌐 White Labeling (Optional)
- Organizations can optionally add their company logo and color scheme.
- This includes login page branding, PDF reports, and dashboard top bar.

🛠️ Admin Capabilities in SaaS Context
- Super Admin (Org-level): Full access to organization setup, users, surveys, analytics.
- Admin: As previously described, scoped within the organization.
- Platform Owner (SaaS Owner): The root user managing billing, feature flagging, and analytics for all tenants.

📊 Global Platform Metrics (SaaS Owner Only)
- Total tenants, active users, audit completions per day/week/month.
- Tenant usage stats (API usage, storage, etc.)
- Billing and churn insights.

💡 SaaS Edge Case Considerations
- Survey templates can be cloned by organizations, but not shared across tenants.
- Billing failures suspend access but retain data for 30–60 days before purge.
- The platform must scale horizontally to support concurrent tenant activity.
