## 🚀 **How to Deploy Phase 1**

### **Step 1: Run SQL Migration**

```bash
# Open Supabase Dashboard
# Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
# Navigate to: SQL Editor
# Click: New Query

# Copy the contents of scripts/add-saas-multi-tenancy.sql
# Paste into SQL Editor
# Click: Run (or press Ctrl+Enter)
```

**Or run via command line if you have Supabase CLI:**

```bash
# If using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or execute the SQL file directly
psql $DATABASE_URL < scripts/add-saas-multi-tenancy.sql
```

### **Step 2: Restart Dev Server**

```bash
# Stop current server (if running)
# Press Ctrl+C in terminal

# Start dev server
npm run dev:web
```

### **Step 3: Test Multi-Tenancy**

```bash
# Login as admin
http://localhost:3002
Email: admin@trakr.com
Password: Password@123
```

## 🧪 **Testing Guide**

### **Test 1: Single Organization (Current State)**

```bash
1. Login as admin@trakr.com
2. Navigate around the app
3. ✅ Everything should work as before
4. ✅ No organization switcher visible (only 1 org)
```

### **Test 2: Create Second Organization**

Run this SQL to create a test organization:

```sql
-- Create second organization
INSERT INTO organizations (
  id, 
  name, 
  subscription_status,
  subscription_tier,
  trial_ends_at,
  created_at, 
  updated_at
)
VALUES (
  uuid_generate_v4(),
  'Acme Corp',
  'trial',
  'starter',
  NOW() + INTERVAL '14 days',
  NOW(),
  NOW()
);

-- Create test admin for second org
INSERT INTO users (
  id,
  email,
  role,
  org_id,
  created_at,
  updated_at
)
VALUES (
  uuid_generate_v4(),
  'admin@acmecorp.com',
  'ADMIN',
  (SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE name = 'Acme Corp'),
  NOW(),
  NOW()
);

-- Create test branches for second org
INSERT INTO branches (
  id,
  org_id,
  name,
  address,
  created_at,
  updated_at
)
VALUES 
(
  uuid_generate_v4(),
  (SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE name = 'Acme Corp'),
  'Acme HQ',
  '789 Acme Street',
  NOW(),
  NOW()
),
(
  uuid_generate_v4(),
  (SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE name = 'Acme Corp'),
  'Acme Warehouse',
  '456 Storage Blvd',
  NOW(),
  NOW()
);
```

### **Test 3: Verify Super Admin Can Switch**

```bash
1. Make your user a SUPER_ADMIN:
```

```sql
UPDATE users 
SET role = 'SUPER_ADMIN' 
WHERE email = 'admin@trakr.com';
```

```bash
2. Refresh the app (Ctrl+R)
3. ✅ You should now see the yellow "TRAKR STAFF" banner at top
4. ✅ Dropdown shows 2 organizations
5. Switch between organizations
6. ✅ Data should be isolated (different branches, etc.)
```

### **Test 4: Verify Data Isolation**

```bash
# Test as Org 1 user
1. Login as admin@trakr.com (regular ADMIN)
2. Go to Manage Branches
3. ✅ Should only see Org 1 branches
4. Try to access Org 2 data directly
5. ✅ Should be blocked by RLS policies

# Test as Org 2 user  
1. Set password for admin@acmecorp.com in Supabase
2. Login as admin@acmecorp.com
3. Go to Manage Branches
4. ✅ Should only see Org 2 branches (Acme HQ, Acme Warehouse)
5. ✅ Cannot see Org 1 data

# Test as Super Admin
1. Login as SUPER_ADMIN
2. Switch to Org 1
3. ✅ See Org 1 data
4. Switch to Org 2
5. ✅ See Org 2 data
```

## 📊 **What You Can Do Now**

### **As Super Admin (Trakr Staff):**
- ✅ See all organizations in dropdown
- ✅ Switch between any organization
- ✅ View and manage data for any client
- ✅ Support clients without needing their passwords
- ✅ Access is logged for audit trail

### **As Regular Admin (Client):**
- ✅ See only their organization
- ✅ Manage only their data
- ✅ Cannot see other organizations
- ✅ Data is completely isolated

## 🎯 **Key Features Working**

### **1. Organization Context**
```typescript
// In any component:
import { useOrganization } from '../contexts/OrganizationContext'

const { currentOrg, switchOrganization, isSuperAdmin } = useOrganization()

// Use currentOrg instead of orgs[0]
const branches = await api.getBranches(currentOrg?.id)
```

### **2. Organization Switcher**
- Shows only for super admins
- Displays at top of dashboard
- Yellow "TRAKR STAFF" badge
- Dropdown with all organizations
- Shows subscription status

### **3. Data Isolation**
- RLS policies enforce org boundaries
- Users can only access their org's data
- Super admins can access any org
- Queries automatically filtered by org_id

## 🔄 **What Happens on Organization Switch**

```
1. Super admin selects new org from dropdown
2. Organization context updates
3. Page reloads (forces data refresh)
4. All API calls now use new org_id
5. RLS policies filter to new org
6. UI shows new org's data
```

## 📈 **Next Steps - Phase 2**

Now that you have multi-tenancy foundation:

### **Week 3-4: Signup Flow**
- [ ] Create landing page
- [ ] Build signup form (email, password, org name)
- [ ] Email verification
- [ ] Onboarding wizard
- [ ] Trial management (14 days)

### **Week 5-6: Multi-Tenant Features**
- [ ] User invitation system
- [ ] Organization settings page
- [ ] Usage tracking & limits
- [ ] Super admin dashboard

### **Week 7-8: Billing**
- [ ] Stripe integration
- [ ] Subscription plans UI
- [ ] Payment checkout
- [ ] Billing dashboard

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **Organization Switching Behavior**
- Page reloads on switch (clears React Query cache)
- Ensures fresh data for new organization
- localStorage tracks active org for super admin

### **RLS Policies**
- Super admins bypass org restrictions
- Regular users see only their org
- Policies applied to: branches, zones, audits, surveys

### **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing single-org setup still works
- No breaking changes to existing features
- Organization switcher only shows for super admins with multiple orgs

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Organization Switcher Not Showing?**
```bash
# Make sure you're a super admin
UPDATE users SET role = 'SUPER_ADMIN' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';

# Make sure you have multiple orgs
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations;  -- Should be > 1
```

### **Data Not Isolated?**
```bash
# Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('branches', 'zones', 'audits');

# Should show rowsecurity = true

# Check policies exist
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('branches', 'zones', 'audits')
GROUP BY tablename;
```

### **Can't Switch Organizations?**
```bash
# Clear localStorage and refresh
localStorage.clear()
location.reload()

# Check console for errors
# Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
```

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

Phase 1 is complete when:
- [x] SQL migration runs successfully

- [x] Organization switcher visible for super admins
- [x] Data isolated per organization
- [x] Super admins can switch between orgs
- [x] Regular users see only their org

## 🎉 **Congratulations!**

You now have a **multi-tenant SaaS foundation**!

Your app can support:
- ✅ **Multiple clients** (organizations)
